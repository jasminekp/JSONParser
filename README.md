CSE 681 - Software Modeling

Project Phase 1:
	
	The JSONParser Project is a standalone command-line program written in Visual Studio using the C++ Language.
	The command-line program prompts the user for input to a web URL containing JSON formatted data and allows the user to select from three options. 

	The data structure used to hold all the JSON Object data is a struct named matchUpStats. All individual MatchUpStats are combined into a vector of MatchUpStats.


Project Phase 2:
	The JSONParser Project has been modified to calculate each team's season records (wins, losses, and ties) and print the scores to the console.


Project Phase 3:
	The JSONParser Project has been modified to incorporate a GUI to load team's season records.


Project Phase 4:
	The JSONParser Project has been modified to be a multithreading application.
